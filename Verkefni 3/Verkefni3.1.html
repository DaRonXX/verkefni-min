        Full force warriors (hu)<br>
        The axes now are aiming<br>
        Straight at the heart of the battle<br>
        We praise the crown with their blood<br>
        <br>
        Here all my brothers are standing<br>
        To face the ranks of the enemy<br>
        Shines on the stone of the mountain<br>
        <br>
        The dwarves of iron and gold<br>
        In the fray, in the fire, we are marching on<br>
        Till the end, through the dark we are holding on<br>
        Far from our home we're standing as one<br>
        <br>
        When the battlefield calls together we're marching on<br>
        In the fray, in the fire, we are marching on<br>
        Till the end, we're still holding on<br>
        Together we fall, together we fight<br>
        And once together we rise<br>
        <br>
        We are the fire for the smithery<br>
        We are ready to burn<br>
        We are the cold of the winter night<br>
        We are blinded by the blood of our enemies<br>
        <br>
        And once together we rise<br>
        We are the fire for the smithery<br>
        We are ready to burn<br>
        <br>
        We are the cold of the winter night<br>
        We are blinded by the blood of our enemies<br>
        And once together we rise<br>
        Strong is the blow of the hammers<br>
        Smashing their lines overwhelmed<br>
        <br>
        By steel ranks of dwarves in the frontline<br>
        To fight until they will fall<br>
        We don't look back or surrender<br>
        Cursed is the fate of contenders<br>
        The wrath of dwarves is upon them<br>
        <br>
        Coming from the depths of the mountain halls<br>
        Rise with force through the fire you'll stand with us<br>
        Tales of war burn like flame on winter nights<br>
        Rise with force through this night you'll stand with us<br>
        <br>
        Side by side till the end we'll stand as one<br>
        Rise with force through the fire you'll stand with us<br>
        Tales of war burn like flame on winter nights<br>
        <br>
        Rise with force through this night you'll stand with us<br>
        Side by side till the end we'll stand as one<br>
        In the fray, in the fire, we are marching on<br>
        Till the end, through the dark we are holding on<br>
        Far from our home we're standing as one<br>

        We are ready to burn<br>
        <br>
        We are the cold of the winter night<br>
        We are blinded by the blood of our enemies<br>
        And once together we rise<br>
        <br>
        We are the fire for the smithery<br>
        We are ready to burn<br>
        We are the cold of the winter night<br>
        We are blinded by the blood of our enemies<br>
        <br>
        And once together we rise<br>
        We walk into the twilight<br>
        We walk into the twilight<br>
        <br>
        And once together we rise<br>
        We walk into the twilight<br>
        We walk into the twilight<br>
        The dwarves together will rise<br>

        <h2>The King Under the Mountain</h2><br>
        Hail the king under the mountain!<br>
        A new king arises<br>
        to reclaim his deathless throne<br>
        The world is grey, The mountains old<br>
        <br>
        Nowhere's home, No stars above us all<br>
        Dark is the chasm of time<br>
        Where all are drowned<br>
        <br>
        No gold ores, No hammers fall<br>
        Nowhere are chants, Sung by Durin's folk<br>
        Shades haunt and hover in the night, n Khazad-dum<br>
        Sons of AulÃ«, answer to my call<br>
        Bring back the shining to the frozen halls<br>
        <br>
        Blow the warhorns, let them be heard<br>
        Light the forge abandoned to the mold<br>

        <br>
        Blow the warhorns, let them be heard<br>
        Raise your hammers and<br>
        Far is the age, Empty is the throne<br>
        Dark the morn<br>
        <br>
        No lanterns burn in the halls<br>
        Ashes and bones of our kind<br>
        Upon his cairn made of stone<br>
        <br>
        The fallen reign of the dwarves<br>
        Glows like embers under the stone<br>
        Buried and maybe forgotten<br>
        But still burning on<br>
